            Protostar is an entirely student-run organization that provides high school students the resources and innovative thinking
            needed to launch a successful startup. Whether we're teaching student market segmentation, or competitive position, we will
            teach students the ABC's of entrepreneurship and help them develop the vital skills needed to create a real startup. Our mission 
            is to incite creativity within the young entrepreneur and provide the necessary resources and tools needed to build the ideal 
            world they envision. By providing teenage entrepreneurs with the platform and tools to develop their creativity and network with other like-minded peers, 
            we hope to inspire students with the tenacity to build and pursue their own viable startups. The focus of the program is on taking
            action, learning from results, helping students become successful entrepreneurs, and most importantly, having fun. 
            In other words, we're pretty cool ;)
