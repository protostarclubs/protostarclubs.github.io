      <p class = "sect-text">
        The world is in a dire need for forward-thinking problem solvers who are willing to challenge decades of traditional thinking in order to tackle complex issues that
        are hindering the progression of humanity in brand new innovative ways. 
        <br><br>
        In the midst of a technological revolution, entrepreneurs will be the catalyst for change towards today's most complex challenges. Yet, the field faces a shortage in 
        underrepresented individuals (either in age, gender, or ethnicity) and is generally accompanied by the unwelcoming stigma of "being a businessman". 
        <br><br>
        Protostar strives to change that. Our mission is two-fold:
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Redefine "entrepreneurship" and transform the startup ecosystem to become more inclusive.</i></b>
        <br><br>
        Today's modern-day definition of "entrepreneurship" is outdated. It reflects the misconception that "entrepreneurship" is a verb meaning "to create a business", when in reality it's much
        more than that. It's a mindset.
        <br><br>
        By providing teenage entrepreneurs the platform and tools to develop their creativity and network with other like-minded peers, 
        we hope to inspire students with the tenacity to build and pursue their own viable startups, molded to fit their own ideal of the world.
        <br><br>
        The focus of our program is on taking action, learning from results, helping students become successful entrepreneurs, and most importantly, having fun.
      </p>
   

      <p class = "content" style = "color: black; margin-left: 13%; margin-top: 1%">Community Initiatives 💃</p> 
      <p class = "sect-text">
          We believe that a feeling of unity and support is integral for everyone's success, as such, our program ultimately revolves around connecting like-minded individuals and building a strong, 
          welcoming community. We do this in several ways:
          <br><br>
          <b>1. After-School Programs 🏫</b>
          <br>
          Our after-school programs equip high school students with the resources and curriculum needed to start their own authentic startups, from ideation all the way to fruition. 
          The best part? They're entirely student-led as well! Apply today to become a chapter leader!
          <br><br>
          <b>2. Communal Meetings 🎤</b>
          <br>
          Though our goal is to eventually have a club at every school, we recognize that not everyone has access to a Protostar chapter. For this reason, we often hold communal meetings 
          that essentilly go over the same topics covered for that month. Any high school student is welcome to attend! 
          <br><br>
          <b>3. Informal Social Networking Events 🎳</b>
          <br>
          Most social networking events are very nerve-wrecking and quite frankly boring. Our approach to developing these vital networking skills is by creating a chill, and welcoming atmosphere where anyone
          is welcome to attend. We're not all just about entrepreneurship. We like to have fun too, so even bowling can be a great way to meet others!
          <br><br>
          <b>4. Field Trips 🚌</b>
          <br>
          Entrepreneurship is a universal skill, not only relevant to tech. We like to showcase the possibilities entrepreneurship has to offer by hosting field trips to local startups
          or incubator spaces. 
      </p>


      <p class = "content" style = "color: black; margin-left: 13%; margin-top: 1%" > Demo Day! 🎉 </p>   
      <p class = "sect-text">
        Over the course of the year, students will form teams of three to six students, receive the ability to get team-based mentorship from
        experienced professionals, and launch a startup based on a topic of their choosing, whether it be related to art, music, 
        computer science, environmental science, etc. With several chapters around the Chicagoland area, including
        Lane Tech and Jones College Prep, Protostar culminates with Demo Day: a Shark-Tank style business competition where high school students can pitch their startups
        to a panel of seasoned entrepreneurs for a chance to receive up to $1000 in non-dilutive funding. 
        <br><br>The best part? It's completely free and <b>any high school student</b> is welcome to register and compete!
      </p>

      <p class = "sect-text">
          By building a community of teenage entrepreneurs and providing them the platform to showcase their creativity, we are building the next wave of diverse 21st century innovators and change-makers.
          Quite ironically, the aim of our program is not necessarily to create a business, but rather develop vital soft skills, a forward-thinking and business-oriented mindset, 
          connections with like-minded individuals, experience in a preferred field, and a portfolio to showcase all of their endeavours! In our first inaugural year, we have already impacted:
