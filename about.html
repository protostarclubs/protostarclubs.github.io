                Protostar is an entirely student-run organization that provides high school students the resources and innovative thinking
                needed to launch a successful startup. Whether we're teaching student market segmentation, or competitive position, we will
                teach students the ABC's of entrepreneurship and help them develop the vital skills needed to create a real startup. Our mission 
                is to incite creativity within the young entrepreneur and provide the necessary resources and tools needed to build the ideal 
                world they envision. By providing teenage entrepreneurs with the platform and tools to develop their creativity and network with other like-minded peers, 
                we hope to inspire students with the tenacity to build and pursue their own viable startups. The focus of the program is on taking
                action, learning from results, helping students become successful entrepreneurs, and most importantly, having fun. 
                In other words, we're pretty cool ;)

                Over the course of the year, students will form of three to six students, receive the ability to get team-based mentorship from
                experienced professionals, and found a startup based on a topic of their choosing, whether it be related to art, music, 
                computer science, environmental issues, etc. With several chapters around the Chicagoland area, including
                Lane Tech and Jones College Prep, Protostar culminates with Demo Day: a Shark-Tank style pitch competition
                where Protostar teams from around the city receive feedback from a panel of established entrepreneurs and the opportunity to 
                compete for a $1000 prize pool to continue their ventures.

            According to <i>Wikipedia</i>, a protostar is "a very young star that is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud" and one of the earliest phases in the process of stellar evolution.
            For us, Protostars are a great metaphor to describe our students. Like protostars, our students are emerging entrepreneurs who have just begun their entrepreneurial journey. 
            Starting out, they will heavily rely on us and their mentors to guide them through the difficult and obstacle-ridden 
            journey of becoming a full-fledged entrepreneur, just like a protostar!
