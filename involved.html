                    We have a few, limited spots on our Executive Team open to any capable individual with a passion for entrepreneurship. They will work directly with the Protostar founders

                    hands-on experience running an organization, as well as meeting other like-minded individuals. 
                    <br><br>
                    We are always looking for diverse candidates, so even if you have absolutely no prior experience, apply anyway! We can't wait to read your application!

                    Advisers are matched up with a team
                    at the start of the program and offer them feedback/advice on all phases of their entrepreneurial journey.
                    <br><br>
                    Time commitment is no more than an hour bi-weekly and means of communication is up to the mentor/advisor's preference. This is the perfect option if you would like
