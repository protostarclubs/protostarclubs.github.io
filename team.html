                  <span id="moreYames">
                      inflicting change. For her, entrepreneurship is a mindset of constant pursuit
                      and resiliency in the face of adversity. Outside of Protostar, she leads CS workshops at local middle schools, acts as
                      a mentor in her local library, and is heavily involved in all-female or all-Latinx CS communities as an NCWIT Awardee, Techqueria member,
                      and LatinX Scholar. During her free time, she likes to workout at her local boxing gym, drink copious amounts of coffee,
                      listen to Thrice, and attend local hackathons and tech meetups. Through her experiences, she hopes to close the gender and racial gap in STEM
                      and inspire Latinas and first generation Americans, like herself, to pursue careers in STEM.
