              <h3>Co-Founder & CEO</h3>
              <p style = "font-size: 16px;">
                Yamilett is a sophomore at Lane Tech College Prep, and an advocate for greater inclusivity in STEM. Driven by an unquenchable curiosity and intrinsic passion
                for social good, she leverages the intersection between CS + entrepreneurship in order to inflict change within her community. 
                Outside of Protostar, she leads CS workshops at local middle schools, 
                organizes hackathons, and is heavily involved in all-female or all-Latinx CS communities as an NCWIT Awardee, Stanford SHE++ Fellow, and Techqueria member.
                During her free time, she likes to workout at her local boxing gym, explore local coffee shops, and attend hackathons with her friends. 
                Through her experiences, she hopes to close the gender and racial gap in STEM and inspire Latinas and other first-generation Americans, like herself, to pursue careers in STEM.
