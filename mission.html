            We live on a planet with finite resources and a rapidly increasing world population.
            <br><br>
            Now, more than ever, the world is in a dire need for forward-thinking problem solvers who are willing to challenge
            decades of traditional thinking in order to tackle complex issues that are hindering the progression of humanity, in brand new innovative ways.
            <br><br>
            In the midst of a Digital Revolution, entrepreneurs will undoubtedly be the driving force behind the solutions for issues plaguing society today.
            Yet, the field faces a shortage in underrepresented individuals (either in age, gender, or ethnicity) and is generally accompanied by the unwelcoming stigma of "being a businessman".
            <br><br>
            We're here to change that.
            <br><br>
            Founded in 2019 by four passionate teenagers, Protostar has evolved from a mere school club to a student-run high school incubator program with numerous chapters throughout the Chicagoland area.
            Driven by the three core principles of collaboration, creativity, and diversity, we are a collection of creatives who leverage the intersection between STEAM and entrepreneurship in order to solve humanityâ€™s
            most crucial challenges.
            <br><br>
            Our mission is two-fold: <br><br><i><span class = "gradient-underline">Redefine "entrepreneurship" and transform the startup ecosystem to become more inclusive.</span></i>
            <br><br>
            Today's modern-day definition of "entrepreneurship" is outdated. It reflects the misconception that "entrepreneurship" is solely centered around "creating a business," when in reality it's much
            more than that: it's a mindset of constant innovation, constant creativity, diverse perspectives, and a resilience unparallel to no other.
            <br><br>
            By providing teenage entrepreneurs the platform and tools to develop their creativity and network with other like-minded peers, we hope to inspire students with the tenacity to build
            and pursue their own viable startups, molded to fit their own ideal of the world.
            <br><br>
            Age is just a number and <i>anyone</i> is capable of inciting real and meaningful change in their communities. With upwards thinking, our students will learn how to reach the upper bounds of the atmosphere,
            the upper bounds of space, and the upper bounds of their full potential.
